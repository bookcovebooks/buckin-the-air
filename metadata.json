  "description": "When two down-on-their-luck cowboys strike gold at a rodeo and receive a crooked judge's invitation to split prize money, their celebration lands them in hot water with the law. Fleeing an angry mob—led by a marshal wielding a pistol and a vengeful shopkeeper brandishing a mannequin leg—they hitch a ride that turns into their most dangerous adventure yet: a flight in a questionable airplane with dubious fuel reserves. A wild, humorous tale of Old West mischief colliding with early aviation.",
